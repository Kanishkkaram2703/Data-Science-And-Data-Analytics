#Titanic Survival Prediction

the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic and whether they survived or not. 
Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical features into numerical ones. 
Then, train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or Decision Tree) to predict passenger survival. 
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and create a confusion matrix.

Predicting Titanic survival using Python typically involves using machine learning techniques to analyze passenger data and determine their likelihood of survival. Here’s a brief overview of the steps involved:

Data Collection: You typically use the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Some data might be missing (e.g., ages, cabin numbers), which you need to fill in (impute) or remove.
Feature Engineering: Convert categorical variables (like 'Sex' and 'Embarked') into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Scaling: Normalize features to bring them onto a similar scale.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand relationships and patterns (e.g., survival rates by gender, age, and class).

Model Building:

Selecting a Model: Common choices include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
Training the Model: Split the data into training and test sets. Use the training set to teach the model how to predict survival.
Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance using the test set and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict survival on new or unseen data.

This script:

Loads the Titanic dataset.
Preprocesses the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Splits the data into training and test sets.
