Titanic Survival Prediction

the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic and whether they survived or not. 
Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical features into numerical ones. 
Then, train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or Decision Tree) to predict passenger survival. 
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and create a confusion matrix.
